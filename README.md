# Predicting-Breast-Cancer-Malignancy-Using-Machine-Learning
The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model to predict whether a breast cancer tumor is malignant or benign based on features computed from breast cancer images. The project involves data exploration, preprocessing, model building, evaluation, and interpretation.
